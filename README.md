## üìù Project

This project was developed during the classes in Chapter II of the Rocketseat Bootcamp Ignite ReactJS track,
and where in the initial project it was only possible to create and list the expenses.

The following features have been added by me:

#### Exclude an expense
#### Edit an expense
#### Filter spent by title
